<p>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to 
connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</p>
<p>Writing readable, maintainable, and adaptable code is done in small pieces. Our AnimalShelter module takes 4-6 tasks and did each one in a function. Each function
was easy to understand. Written in this fashion the module is easy to understand and reuse.</p>

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create 
databases to meet other client requests?


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists do a variety of things. Only one of those things is write code.
Access to the AAC database could be done at the command line in Mongodb. Doing so, however, is not easy or intuitive. The goal of software should be to make life
easier. Having a dashboard with radio buttons that displays filtered database data is much nicer and easier for nontechnical people to interact with.
